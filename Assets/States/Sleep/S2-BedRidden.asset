  storyText: Yeah, passing out just like that never leads to anything good. You make
    time for a quick shower, a change of clothes and then, finally, give in to the
    sweet embrace of your mattress. You lose consciousness before you even hit the
    pillow. Sweet dreams, you beautiful bastard. God knows you earned it today.
