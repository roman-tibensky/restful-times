    not stopping. You look up from your couch-burrow. Everything's so dark. You can
    barely see a small opening in the cushions. How far have you sunken into this
    thing!? You make a very faint attempt to reach for the opening, but it closes
    before you can grab it. The couch swallows you whole."
