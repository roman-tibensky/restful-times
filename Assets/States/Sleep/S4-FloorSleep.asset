  storyText: "Wouldn't be the first time you passed out somewhere on the floor. Probably
    not the last time either. You're too tired to feel neither shame nor your legs
    anymore. Just.... close your eyes, slide on the floor, worry about terrible backaches
    later.\r\n\r\nYou are rudely awoken by a sudden, long tug and an assault of light
    to your eyes. You blink and go \"What the fuck\" as you try and makes sense of
    your surroundings. Your surroundings, in response, yell at you in panic. This
    naturally startles you awake. You scream back, try to crawl away from the sound,
    only to fall off whatever you were laying on, With the help of the back of your
    head, you find the ground  about 3 feet below you. You scream in pain! Someone
    else screams in response! You scream in frustration from all the screaming!"
