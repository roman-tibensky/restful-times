  storyText: "After a lot more screaming though, you finally get to learn what the
    hell happened. You're in a morgue! \r\n\r\nYou were brought here because the cleaning
    lady found you on the floor in the morning and called the police. The responding
    officer was one of your old pals and since your sleep was nigh comatose level,
    the absolute ass apparently decided to play a joke on both you and the coroner.
    You aren't amused. Thanks to being stuck in the corpse-box for several hours,
    you are both cold and stiff as death itself and everything hurts. You decide to
    get him back later. Much later. After a three hour long hot shower and maybe a
    gallon of steaming hot coffee. God, it feels like you'll never feel warmth again."
  choiceText1: 1) Well, it's official. Being dead is the third worst thing that happened
    to me after I passed out on the floor. (You've made it to the next day - see result
    of your resting)
