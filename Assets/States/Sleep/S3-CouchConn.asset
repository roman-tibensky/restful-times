  storyText: "Well, you only got the couch a couple of days ago, along with a bunch
    of other furniture and junk. Might as well break it in? At least that's the reasoning
    you give yourself as you drag your dead-tired butt towards the living room. \r\n\r\nTo
    be honest, it looks fairly old. It definitely has seen better days, but as with
    the other stuff you've acquired it with, you got it for criminally cheap. And
    to your exhausted brain, it looks like the most comfortable thing to ever exist.
    You slide into the couch cushions, make yourself comfortable. Ah, bliss. The couch
    cushions envelop you in a cocoon of coziness. You sink deeper and deeper into
    the couch itself. You are so comfortable, you feel like you're almost becoming
    one with the plush fabric. And yet, you still feel yourself sinking further.\r"
