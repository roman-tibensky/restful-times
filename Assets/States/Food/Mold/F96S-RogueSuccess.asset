  storyText: "For the stealth mission your stomach offered to take the lead. You raise
    your eyebrow just slightly and agree, just to see how this pans out.\r\n...\r\nWho
    would've thought having a sentient gut feeling would be this helpful. Your stomach
    practically guided you throughout the mansion without a single soul crossing your
    path. Thanks to your attached personal pathfinder you made it safely into the
    mansion, did the ritual without any interruptions and then ran like hell to get
    as far away from the zone ward's radius as possible. You make it to the nearest
    window and start climbing out, when a massive force pushes you out and singes
    your coat. Holy shit, was that a potent ward. Almost cleaned you up in the process
    as well!\r\nBut the quest is done and you can now enjoy the fruit of your labor
    at the comfort of your home."
