  storyText: "With the careful eye of an experienced connoisseur, you eye a particular
    patch above the kitchen table. Hmm... The texture seems nice and fluffy, but breaks
    apart too easily, the color a rich black with a hint of green, the smell... well,
    it smells like mold, what do you want from me. But all in all, not the worst batch.
    Could use a few more days to spread about and ripen, but for one person, this
    is just about enough for the desired effect. You take a knife and plate and gently,
    skillfully start scraping the black gold off the ceiling, making sure you leave
    enough for the mold to spread easier for next time. \r\n"
