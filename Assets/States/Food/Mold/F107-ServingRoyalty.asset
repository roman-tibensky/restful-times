  storyText: "You lead the girl into the living room and offered her a seat on the
    couch. She nodded nervously in response and tried to make herself comfortable.
    You stared at the  girl with a hint of jealousy, since you just bought the damn
    thing; didn't even get the chance to break it in before some posh twerp claimed
    ownership with her buttocks.\r\n\r\nThe couch did not approve either. Its form
    started twisting into some grotesque face. At first you weren't sure if you were
    seeing things right - there was no way a couch would grin at you, right? But the
    moment it started growing teeth, you had to face the facts:"
  choiceText1: 1) My couch got replaced by a fucking mimic!
  choiceText2: 2) Oh... right... I'm high as a kite. There's no way any of this is
    real.
