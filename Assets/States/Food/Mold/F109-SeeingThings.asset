  storyText: "You feel like an idiot. In the present day of current year you actually
    believed that there was a princess in your house that needed protection and that
    your couch tried to eat her. How stupid was that?\r\n\r\nYou decided to just close
    your eyes and count to three. Once you open them, all of the nonsense would be
    gone. Ready?\r\nOne... Two... Three...\r\nYou open your eyes and, indeed, the
    princess is gone and the couch returned to normal. Not even your stomach is smiling
    at you anymore. Glad that's over with!\r\nOr so you think. The door bell rings.
    You open the door and you see the guys from the pizza mafia. They're asking about
    a protection target they left with you. A guy you never saw in your life. You
    shake your head in denial, but no matter how much you try and explain that there
    was no male guest at your home, they wouldn't budge. Apparently, you lost their
    protectee. And in return, you lose your life."
