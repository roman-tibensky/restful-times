  storyText: "Hey, why get close, when you can do your job remotely? You sneak up
    just about close enough for a decent throw, you prepare the ritual, you aim for
    one of the windows, you throw the ward in a perfect arc and just watch the fireworks
    as the wards does its job. It is a thing of beauty to say the least. The pillar
    of light burned anything and everything it touched and the screams of the purified
    rang forth the completion of your quest.\r\nYour work? Done.\r\nThe light show?
    Damn satisfying.\r\nThe reward? Delicious."
  choiceText1: 1) Finally sitting down with food after such an exhausting day and
