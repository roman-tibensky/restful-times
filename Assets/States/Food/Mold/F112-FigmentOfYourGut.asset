  headerText: Yeah, why WERE you talking to your stomach?
  storyText: "\"Oh... I guess that makes sense. Man, am I drunk... talking to some
    dude's belly,\" the princess sighed. \"What even is my life anymore. I... should
    take a nap, this is just bad.\" She barely even finished the last sentence and
    slumped on the kitchen chair, then passed out with her head on the table.\r\n\r\nThat's
    a nice outcome for you, since you don't have to take care of her anymore, but
    you are feeling a little bit bitter that your stomach would make fun of you like
    that. That's just rude.\r\n\r\nEventually, Prince Charming TM came and picked
    her up. He gave you your quest reward and left you to your own devices. The reward
    itself was this disc-like bread with tomato sauce, cheese and salami. What a peculiar
    invention! You had a few reservations of giving your stomach a reward if it would
    even deny its own sentience, but your hunger and curiosity overwhelm you as you
    dig in."
