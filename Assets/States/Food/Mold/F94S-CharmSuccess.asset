  storyText: "You don't fear no goblins. You are a charmer, a charismatic presence
    and all around swell chap. Goblins should be no problem! All you have to do is
    make em see that listening to you is not such a bad idea. You manage to strike
    up a conversation, you convince them that their layer is full of bad, bad things.
    You give them the means to get rid of the bad things. The goblins seem to be a
    mix of overwhelmed and cooperative. All in all, you feel quite accomplished. The
    two guard goblins disappear into the building with your ward and you put a bit
    of distance between you and the building, so you can watch the ward being activated
    in its full glory.\r\n\r\nAnd it is indeed a sight to behold  a golden flash enveloped
    the building in glorious light. Fricken beautiful.\r\nQuest complete!\r\nReward:
    Divine Nourishment of the Gods"
