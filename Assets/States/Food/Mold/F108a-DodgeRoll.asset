  storyText: "Your determination is nigh scary. Prince Charming TM came along with
    your quest reward before you were finished. You didn't even take the time to properly
    greet him, just told him to set your reward on the table while continuously stabbing
    the couch until they were long gone. Only then, finally, you sat down to devour
    your reward. \r\n...\r\n...\r\n...\r\nAfter you eat to your heart's content and
    come down from your high, you start questioning what exactly happened though.
    A couch? Eating people? Princesses? What the hell was up up with this batch of
    mold. That's just goofy."

    a good idea? (Objective complete!)
