  storyText: "\"Brave warrior, here in the outskirts of your village lies a den of
    evil most wretched,\" your stomach decided to narrate your situation as you neared
    your destination. It looked like an old abandoned building in the middle of a
    forest. The kind that would be 120% haunted given half the chance.\r\n\"I know
    what you're thinking, sir. But today, we face no restless spirits. A horde of
    goblins occupies this decaying mansion, the rumors of hauntings only helping them
    drive good people away. But you are different, sir. You are brave enough to face
    these vile creatures. Except I wouldn't face them per se. They will kill you on
    sight and make you into soup. I'd rather get food then become food, sir. How do
    you wish to proceed?\""

    with them!" (Persuasion check)
  choiceText2: 2) "I'd rather not get close if I can help it. Activate the ward here
    and just throw it at the mansion from over here" (Athletics check)
  choiceText3: 3) "I'm a pro at not being seen. I'll sneak us in no problem." (Stealth
