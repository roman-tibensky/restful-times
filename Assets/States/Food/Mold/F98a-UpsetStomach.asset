  headerText: Upset stomach
  storyText: "Your stomach just went off and refused to hit the breaks. You'd feel
    bad for the centaur, but the monologue was roasting you more than insulting the
    potential quest giver. Not that the insults towards the centaur were that much
    tamer. You could see he didn't enjoy them either. His expressions went from anger,
    to confusion, to absolute disgust and ended on defeat.\r\n\"Fine! Fucking take
    those stupid waffles, I lost my appetite just looking at your freak show,\" he
    quickly disappeared into the crowd and left a the remaining waffles behind. Score!\r\nBad
    news though: the other quest marker disappeared, so this is all you were stuck
    with: a half-eaten meal and a sour stomach for company."
  choiceText1: 1) Wish it would at least shut up while I feed it though. So rude.
