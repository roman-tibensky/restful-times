  headerText: Arrival of Royalty
  storyText: "Your conversation with your stomach region was rudely interrupted by
    the announcement of someone standing at your door. That was uncomfortably fast,
    what the hell.\r\n\r\nYou invite her in, the escort leaves. She is cute, you gotta
    admit. She was fairly tall, with long blond hair and a blindingly pink dress.
    You're not entirely sure how you're supposed to hide this woman, since you suspect
    that the glimmer of her dress alone could shine through walls. \n\nYour royal
    guest seems to be quite on edge straight off the bat. But they, people on the
    run usually are."
  choiceText1: 1) Well, don't just stand there, greet the royalty!
  choiceText2: 2) It's super rude to let a girl just stand in the corridor. At least
    have her sit down.
  choiceText3: 3) Poor thing looks shaken to the core. She could use a drink or two.
