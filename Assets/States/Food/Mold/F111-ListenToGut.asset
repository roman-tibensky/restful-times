  storyText: "\"Bringer of wisdom, hu-huh?\" The princess swayed a bit while talking.
    \"Got any wisdom for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" the stomach adds a dramatic pause.
    \"A quest that would purge your own home with fire is foolish. You will never
    win over your people, if you decimate them first. Your search for strength is
    but a lie you tell yourself so you can run away.  But deep inside you already
    know you lost the moment you made a pact with the devil.\"\r\n\r\nSilence fell
    as the shocked princess stared at the cold grin below your ribs. It took another
    sip from the booze mug for her to process all those accusations: \"Oh my god,
    what do you feed that thing for it to be so savage? Fine. What do you think I
    should do then?\""
