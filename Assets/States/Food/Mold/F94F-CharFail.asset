  storyText: "You walk up to the goblins guarding the entrance. You try your best
    to appear non-threatening and friendly. The goblins look at you, more in disbelief
    than anything else. You know, that \"how would anyone be stupid enough to come
    closer\" look. Your next step, your first words of contact will be absolutely
    crucial. And your choice?\r\n \"Sup, you green-ass bitches?\"\r\nAs far as last
    words go, you could've chosen better."
