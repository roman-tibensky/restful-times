  storyText: "Her royal highness took a moment to process your reply:\r\n\n\"So, what
    you're saying is that I've been spoiled all my life,\" you didn't say that, \"
    that I've never properly worked a day in my life,\" you definitely didn't say
    that, \"and thus have no idea what the people under me think or might be going
    through.\" ... okay, maybe you kind of said that a little bit? However, the best
    course of action probably would be to not add anymore fuel to whatever crazy fire
    is burning in her head right now.\r\n\r\nPlus, the princess kind of looked defeated.
    She stared at the ground. You could practically see the aura of guilt manifesting
    itself around her."
  choiceText1: 1) Did I break her? She's just standing there, staring into space.
