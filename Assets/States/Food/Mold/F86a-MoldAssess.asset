  storyText: A decent haul indeed! You're hungry like a wolf, but mold time is special
    time, so you take it slow. You savor every bit. You're starting to feel it - the
    weight of the world just dropping from your shoulders. Your muscles relaxing,
    the tension in your head slowly fading away. You sigh, close your eyes and relax
    a bit after a day too long for words.
  choiceText1: 1) Yeah, this is nice. I'm glad that nothing horrible is happening
    for a change.
