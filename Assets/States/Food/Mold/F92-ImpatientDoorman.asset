  storyText: "Green is a color as good as any. And talking to the guy closest to the
    door means you can leave faster. The exclamation mark in question hovered over
    a gnome-ish figure. A fat, aggravated gnome to boot. You try to appear as friendly
    as you clear your throat and address the creature:\r\n\"Bless thee, my gnomish
    friend, hath thou perchance maybe the item that would aid me in mine quest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who
    you calling gnomish, you dickhead? \r\nThat's not even halfway close to the phrase
    you were supposed to use!\" My, what a rude response straight off the bat. \"Look.
    Whatever. No one would get it right anyway. You were at east tripping towards
    the right direction. I guess. Not that I'd know. This is fucking stupid. Just
    take the damn package and piss off.\" The gnome shoves the ward into your hands
    and disappears. Rude bastard. At least the first part's done."
