  headerText: Remote Rituals = FAIL
  storyText: You try to get as close as you can without being seen and start performing
    the ritual. It's a simple chant and dance, but kinda fun. A lot of fun actually
    you start getting into it a bit too much and loose yourself in the rhythm. Before
    you know it, you are surrounded by goblins listening to you perform James Brown's
    Sex Machine, your original objective forgotten long ago. At least they let you
    stop on your own before they ate you.
  choiceText1: 1) Well, as far as songs to die to go, there's worse one out there,
    I guess? (GAME OVER - retry)
