  storyText: "\"What you know is right: Those scenarios that keep playing out in your
    head over and over, those what ifs that won't stay silent in the back of your
    mind. Make them an answer for your predicament now rather than your personal torture
    for the rest of your days. Your time to repent is woefully short. But it exists.
    Cease it.\"\r\n\r\nThe princess did not respond. She just left the room. Then
    she started yelling instructions at someone. At first you thought she was angry
    with you, but her screams were definitely addressed at someone she knew and conveyed
    a sense urgency rather than anger. You stayed in your kitchen with your favorite
    mug. Ain't no way in hell you're getting even more involved. Was bad enough that
    Prince Charming thought whatever happened was your fault when he came to whisk
    her away. At least you got paid properly with delicious food."
