  storyText: "You let the stream of people carry you closer to the notice boards.
    There you see the quest marker hovering over a bored-looking centaur, chewing
    on some waffles.\r\n\"Centaurs are unpredictable creatures, sir. Please let me
    handle this one,\" your gut suggests. You see no reason why not, especially since
    it lowers the chances of being kicked in the teeth by a pair of hooves.\r\n\r\nYou
    walk up to the centaur and let your stomach do the talking:\r\n\"Pardon me sir.
    We are adventurers looking work. Are you perhaps in need of aid?\"\r\nThe centaur
    glanced you over, but all in all decided to ignore you.\r\n\"I assure you, we
    are quite capable. Any task you might find troubling you, I'm sure we can handle
    for you.\"\r\nThe centaur continues to ignore you though."
