  storyText: "It took several moments, before she snapped out of it.\r\n\r\n\"I fucked
    up.\" Not a very princess-like thing to say in your opinion. \"I need some time
    alone. Can you grab a smoke or something? I need to make a few calls\"\r\n\r\nYou
    shrug and oblige. Grab a beer and your cigarettes and go hang out on the balcony
    with your stomach friend for a while. He's gotta be better company than this crazy
    broad anyway. Time passed as if in a dream. You could hear her talking and yelling
    at a lot of people in your home, but decided that she was just crazy. When her

    disapproving look and shoved your quest reward into your hands. You decided not
    to ask. You're just glad this is over."
