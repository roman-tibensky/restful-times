  storyText: "There are several thoughts that you simply cannot shake off at the moment.
    I mean... a lizardman... selling grilled lizards. Is that like... making sure
    other lizard species don't catch up to you on an evolutionary level? Like if I
    you were to eat a monkey maybe? Or even worse, some form of cannibalism? A self-imposed
    form of population regulation? Dear lord, what if it goes even further... the
    lizardman selling his own children or something.  Like, they're specifically bred
    to for being sold! Maybe he keeps or or two around and threatens them that if
    they misbehave, they'll end up like that. \"Yeah, Karl Jr., you better take out
    the trash or you'll end up like your 213 other siblings.\" Man, are lizard people
    weird. Wonder if they have to learn how to cook their own siblings... Would that
    be scarring for lizard people?\r\n\nYour thought process continued to be an absolute
    train wreck on your way home. The nabbing of the food was easy enough, it was
    the philosophy behind the food that gave you the biggest trouble. The portion
    wasn't too big, but it was enough for the stomach to stop grinning at you and
    go back to normal at least."
  choiceText1: 1) Also, why did the grilled lizard taste like a cream cheese bagel?
