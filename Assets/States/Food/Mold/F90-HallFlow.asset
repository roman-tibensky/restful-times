  headerText: Hall of Countless Paths
  storyText: "The Hall of Countless Paths is... a loud establishment. It's just streams
    of creatures flowing from place to place like a giant river of flesh and loud
    noises. You dislike it here to say the least. You want to be away from this place
    as soon as possible. Your gut seems to feel the same way. When you look down it
    gives you an uneasy grin and has to yell when it speaks so you can hear it through
    the crowd:\r\n\"Sir, this is worse than usual.\"\r\n\"There's barely any room
    to breathe, let alone stand still for a minute. What do we do?\""
  choiceText1: 1)  There's a green quest marker at the door way,
  choiceText2: 2) A blue quest marker at the information board
  choiceText3: 3) Or we could just give up. There's a stall where a lizardman sells
    grilled lizards on a stick. Doubt he's paying enough attention to see us grabbing
    a free sample, sir."
