  storyText: "You're  very confused as to why this was even a question, but her highness
    seemed fairly serious; like she really didn't know what you were talking about.
    Well... might as well indulge her?\r\n\r\n\"Your clothes for one: top quality,
    not a wrinkle, not a single sign of wear, made to fit perfectly. Your figure is
    very refined with a build definitely not suited for warrior, nor peasant. And
    the fact that you have to ask such a question without knowing the answer also
    indicates a bit of a sheltered life, where contact with the common folk such as
    myself is kept to a minimum.\" Plus. You have. A TIARA. ON YOUR HEAD. But apparently
