  storyText: "Hey, what's a meal without a dash of danger and mystery? Boring, that's
    what! After a long day of sitting in your car  and staking out cheating husbands,
    it's good to get a little excitement in your life. Let's see what is up with this
    sandwich. You walk up to the fridge, open it up and lay your eyes on the sad barren
    frozen space inside. Getting around to do groceries was never your strong suit.
    The only thing inside is a barely opened bottle of whiskey and the aforementioned
    sandwich - propped up on a fancy plate , decorated with... all sorts of stuff?
    \n\nAt first, you thought it was just salad, but on second glance, you can see
    tree leaves, twigs and a bit of leather decorating the plate too? Odd choice for
    decor, sure, but the sandwich itself looks downright delicious. Might be that
    most of its appeal stems from your hunger, but at this point you don't really
    care."

  choiceText2: 2) Hungry! Eat! Now!
  choiceText3: 3) Oooh, whiskey!
