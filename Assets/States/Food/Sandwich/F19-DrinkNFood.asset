  headerText: Drinking up an appetite
  storyText: Your head is buzzing something fierce. It's been a long day. And your
    brain is filled to the brim with stray thoughts and noise. Calming down with a
    drink or five might not be the worst idea. Would help you to build up an appetite
    too. You grab a glass, pour yourself quite the amount and just close your eyes
    for a second, savoring the smoky aftertaste and the warm sensation slowly spreading
    across your chest. You let out a calm sigh and open your eyes. You look down to
    eye your dinner for the night... only to find it starting back at you? There were,
    for the lack of better words, tiny little people with leaf-like features sitting
    on your food,  aiming little toothpick spears at you. What the hell. You just
    had one simple drink right? Didn't get a dash of mold to go along with it while
    I wasn't looking, did you?
  choiceText1: 1) There's no way that those things are real. Just grab the sandwich
  choiceText2: 2) I guess I have guests now? Polite greetings should be had?
  choiceText3: 3) ... take another drink see if they go away.
