  storyText: 'Oh leaf man wanna fight? Leaf man will get a fight. You ready your fork,
    much to the cheer of the leaf-crowd. Your leafy opponent smirks. He uses grunts
    an motions to explain the rules. From what you can gather, they are fairly simple:
    whoever loses their weapon first, loses the battle. You nod and the little guy
    lunges at you with far more strength than such a tiny body should be able to produce.
    But you hold fast; parrying and attacking, trying to get the spear stuck  between
    the fork''s prongs. The battle is much more heated than you''d first give it credit
    for and you kind of have to admit that it''s getting fun too! It took quite a
    bit of back and forth, but you finally manage to wrestle the weapon off your adversary.
    He bows. The crowd bows. They offer you the sandwich. You bow back and claim your
    prize. An unexpected turn of events, but it really built up your appetite. Made
    the sandwich an all the more satisfying meal.'
