  storyText: 'Yeah, enough of this. Just get rid of em. You drunkenly swat your hands
    at the leafy people. They put up much more resistance than you''d thought, but
    you manage to toss them away. Only when they''re off the sandwich though do you
    notice a sharp pain in your hand. You take a better look and see that your sorry
    ass was too drunk to properly feel being stabbed by like a dozen of tooth pick
    spears. You curse, grab the sandwich before the green ones can recuperate and
    close the fridge behind you. A good portion of the night was then spent trying
    to fix your hand. Getting the splinters out, disinfecting, and bandaging took
    so long that you managed to sober up in the meantime. The pain of your hand intensified
    and overtook your urge to eat. You forced like half a sandwich down at best. Couldn''t
    even bring yourself to put it back into the fridge and it''s now just laying on
    your counter. '
