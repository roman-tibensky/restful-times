  storyText: As the smell of food hits your nostrils,  it's just too much to bare
    anymore. Your greedy fingers snap at the cold treat so fast even you don't realize
    it happened before the liberating taste of bread, salad and meat(?) spreads in
    your mouth. Oh, sweet release from hunger! .... bit crunchy though... Ouch! The
    hell was that? You reach inside your mouth and take out a... toothpick? With a
    tiny spearhead? You stare at it perplexed. Then you spot some movement in the
    corner of your eye. You follow it to the plate in the fridge and see what could
    only be described as tiny people spliced with salad coming out from behind the
    leaves giving you and absolutely horrified look. Politely, you give a similar
    one back.
  choiceText1: 1) Greet them with the classic "What the fuck"
  choiceText2: 2) Gulp...
  choiceText3: 3) What the hell is in my mouth right now...
