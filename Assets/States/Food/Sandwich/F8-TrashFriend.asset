  storyText: You don't know what this thing is. You don't WANT to know what this thing
    is. You only know that after where it was, you never ever want to see it again.
    Ever. Without thinking, you toss the struggling creature into the garbage disposal.
    It's cries were loud, but swiftly silenced by the motor powering the blades. You
    look away trying to wipe the image of that thing squirming in your mouth from
    your brain. But it seems you were the only one who wished to forget. The horrifying
    screams of your unwanted snack and its execution sent the other leaf-people into
    an unstoppable frenzy. They might've been small, but they were surprisingly strong,
    fast and many. You put up a fight using a rolled up newspaper, but you were quickly
    overwhelmed and suffered an embarrassing death by a thousand toothpicks.
