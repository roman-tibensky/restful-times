  headerText: The food of ancient kings... probably literally
  storyText: You honestly don't know how old this sandwich is. You only know it was
    in the fridge when you bought it at a yard sale along with a bunch of other stuff.
    You were told no one ever dared to take it out, but you don't really see the issue
    here. Obviously those people just weren't as hungry and/or desperate as you.
  choiceText1: 1) Yay, mystery sandwich with mystery meat!
  choiceText2: 2) Wait.... uhhh.... lets just get pizza
  choiceText3: 3) Honestly, when you put it like that, even the mold sounds safer
    to eat.
