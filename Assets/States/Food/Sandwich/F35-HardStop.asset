  storyText: The sandwich stabs you one last time. No more. I shouldn't be doing this,
    but you two need some time apart. I'm sending you to the mafia to get some pizza.
    At least there I can be sure they'll treat you better than.... whatever this is.
    Maybe one day, you'll get to return, stronger, with a better mind set, and being
    able to just plainly tell the sandwich to fuck off. Go forth, I believe in you!
