  storyText: 'You notice that, while the rather lively addition to your sandwich does
    seems to try and get out of your grip, it also tries to do so in a way that wouldn''t
    involve simply falling off. So fall damage seems to be a thing. Good. You also
    notice the other little monsters reluctantly preparing to attack, trying to eye
    a good opportunity where their comrade would not be affected. You raise your hostage
    in front of you, using him almost as a shield, as you get closer and closer to
    the fridge. Almost there. Now the trickiest part: get the little guy in and close
    the fridge without others getting out. You put the little bugger down and prepare
    to close the fridge, when suddenly a half a dozen tooth pick spears bury themselves
    in your arm. You scream and curse and instinctively try to get them off with your
    sandwich hand. The little buggers seemed to have been waiting for this. They lunged
    at the sandwich and tried to pull it back into the fridge. You notice too late
    and flinch away, kicking the fridge door shut. You curse up a small storm trying
    to assess the damage to your arm.... only to notice you''re holding like a half
    a sandwich in your hand. Then you curse up a bigger storm as you lick your wounds
    and try to enjoy what''s left of your spoils of war.'
