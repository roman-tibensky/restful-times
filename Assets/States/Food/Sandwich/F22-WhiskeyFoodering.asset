  headerText: Diplomatic inebriations
  storyText: You point at your own shot and take a sip to demonstrate. Carefully,
    the leaf man does the same... His face changes to disgust, confusion, then, slow
    realization as the alcohol starts to work its way through his tiny body. He takes
    another sip, then notions the others to do the same. Seems like your new friend
    quickly came around to the idea of having a social drink or two. Or ten. And drunken
    singing. And drunken fights. And passing out with your pants on your head. Or
    somebody else's. Truly, their civilization took a huge leap forward this day.
    Surely they won't mind you taking the sandwich in return?
  choiceText1: 1) I bring the booze, they bring the snacks. Fair deal (Objective complete!)
