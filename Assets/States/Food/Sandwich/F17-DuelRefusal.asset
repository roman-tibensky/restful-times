  storyText: Battling a tiny leaf person sounds awkward and you'd probably feel bad
    for kicking his arse. So why not just steal the food instead? You attempt to shove
    him and his cheerleaders away with your fork and just take the damn sandwich that
    way. But when the leaf people saw what you were up to, they all jumped to get
    your hand away from the sandwich together. And they were SURPRISINGLY strong.
    But they were focused so much on your one hand they completely ignored the other.
    You manage to use that to snag the sandwich, but before you get the buggers off
    your hand and close the fridge, they refocus on their sacred food item and attempt
    to get it back. You scream and thrash your arms around, somehow shaking the attackers
    off and closing the fridge. Sadly, after assessing your bounty, you find that
    you only managed to obtain like half the sandwich.
  choiceText1: 1) Just eat it. Ain't no way I'm opening that fridge again (Objective
