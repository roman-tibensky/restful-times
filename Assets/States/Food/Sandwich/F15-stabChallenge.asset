  storyText: Your question is immediately answered as the sandwich opens up and something
    like a cross between a tiny human and salad wearing armor made of tree bark came
    out and started ...chanting at you in a yelling fashion? Seems it wasn't alone
    either. From the garnish a half a dozen more of these creatures came out, all
    of them menacingly chanting away, stomping their little feet. The one in the sandwich
    took some mayonnaise, and smeared it on his leafy face like war paint and then
    pointed at you yelling. Seems the little guy was ready to throw down.
  choiceText1: 1) Oh, It. Is. ON.
  choiceText2: 2) Just push him away and grab the sandwich. What's the worst he could
    possibly do
  choiceText3: 3) Yell back
