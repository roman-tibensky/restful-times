  storyText: Oh... Oh no... oh god. You're quite certain something moved in your mouth.
    Sweet mother-loving Betsy, get it out! You jam your hand in and it the sandwich
    mush out of your mouth to reveal another leaf person wearing sandwich goo and
    what appears to be chewed up armor made of bark. You hold it firm in your hand
    so it could not escape while trying very hard to not lose your lunch as well.
    All the while the inside of the fridge keeps yelling at you in confused, frightened,
    and angry voices.
  choiceText1: 1) Toss whatever the hell that is into the garbage disposal
  choiceText2: "2) Use the little guy as a shield and close the fridge.\r"
  choiceText3: 3) Toss that sandwich spawn back into the icy coldness of the hell
    fridge, or so help me!
