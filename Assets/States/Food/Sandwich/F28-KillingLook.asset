  storyText: "Just what the hell is up with this thing. From the view you're at, it
    looks normal enough. You try and lean a bit closer. For a second you think you
    saw the sandwich move? You lean up real close. Yeah, some for the garnish seems
    to have twitched lightly. You try and get a bit closer still. Suddenly, the sandwich
    bursts open and something jumps at you. You can't even properly see what it is
    before it stabs you in the face. You stumble back, but a half a dozen tiny shadows
    follow. They catch you by surprise and thoroughly overwhelm you with teeny tiny
    spears. You never stood a chance. \n\nAnd Death By a Thousand Pricks is an embarrassing
    way to go."
