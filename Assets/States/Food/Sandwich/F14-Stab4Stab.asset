  headerText: Stab for a stab
  storyText: I mean it's only just. You got stabbed, you should stab back. Who does
    that sandwich think it is anyway, poking you like that. You take a fork and attempt
    to prod the sandwich carefully. But before the steel can even touch the bread
    it was stopped by a long toothpick with a little spearhead at the end bursting
    from inside the sandwich. It had such a force that it pushed the fork out of your
    hand. Startled, your hand twitched and barely caught it before it fell to the
    ground.
