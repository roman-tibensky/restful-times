  headerText: Salad tossing
  storyText: Yeah, enough of this. You aim at the fridge and toss the unwanted addition
    to your dinner straight at his fellows. Readily, they clump together to cushion
    the fall of your live projectile and while they're distracted, you close the fridge
    on them. And them bar it with a chair for good measure. Man, getting food from
    the mafia is less of a hassle than this. As you let out a sigh of relief, you
    examine the sandwich. Then re-examine it. And re-re-examine it. Thankfully, it
    doesn't seem any of the other sandwich parts are moving anymore. You cautiously
    take another bite, but the only thing that surprised you this time was how DAMN
    good the sandwich actually is, like, dayumn.
  choiceText1: 1) Finally some actual food! (Objective complete!)
  choiceText2: 2) I'll replace the salad people's home tomorrow I guess (Objective
    complete!)
