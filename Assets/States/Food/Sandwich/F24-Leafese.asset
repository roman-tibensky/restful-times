  storyText: With no particular plan on how you want to go about starting a conversation,
    you kinda just wave and blurt out a "Hey there". The leafy people stop what they
    are doing and seem to follow your hand with their spears. You wave again and the
    wave of toothpicks follows. It's like you have your own spiky Mexican wave at
    your finger tips. But it didn't bring you any closer to a solution to this situation
    whatsoever.
  choiceText1: 1) Well, they definitely don't want me to get to the sandwich. Just
    get rid of em already.
  choiceText2: 2) Well, they're definitely intelligent. Wonder how they'd react to
    an offering of the, uhh,  spiritual kind.
