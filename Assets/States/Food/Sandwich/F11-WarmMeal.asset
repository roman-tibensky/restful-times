  storyText: Almost anything will taste a bit better if you heat it up. You tiredly
    reach for the cold delicacy. Then you feel a sharp stab in your palm. It comes
    as such a surprise that it actually takes you a few seconds to realize that you're
    supposed to be in pain. But once it hits, it definitely wakes you up. The hell
    was that? Did the sandwich just stab you?
  choiceText1: 1) Take a closer look.
  choiceText2: 2) Try to grab it again
  choiceText3: 3) Stab it with a fork or something
