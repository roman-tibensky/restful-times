  headerText: Drink your problems away
  storyText: Yeah, you really don't have the energy to deal with whatever this is
    supposed to be. Rinsing your brain with more alcohol sounds like the easiest solution
    right now. You take another hefty shot and look down at the sandwich. Nope. They're
    still there. But hey. It was a tasty attempt even if it wasn't a very effective
    one. The little people seem to have become a bit agitated though; chanting and
    shaking their tiny spears at you, with one of them standing on the sandwich yelling
    at you.
  choiceText1: 1) Rude! Swat them away!
  choiceText2: 2) Rude. You should probably tell them to stop
  choiceText3: 3) Well... do THEY wanna join me for a drink?
