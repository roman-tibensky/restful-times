  headerText: Speaking with your mouth full
  storyText: '"Hwah h fuh" You blurt out even forgettting that there''s food in your
    mouth. The salad men yell back and start throwing toothpick spears at you with
    a surprising amount of strength. You barely manage to drop the sandwich and lift
    your hands in front of your face, before they reach you. Sharp, stabbing pain
    spreads across your palms and arms as the tooth picks bury themselves into your
    skin. You barely have any time to recover as another stabbing pain spreads in
    your mouth again. You yell out in surprise and watch as something  slides out
    of your mouth and starts "scaling" you down using two toothpicks. Too bad one
    of the first places it uses is your neck and perforates one of your arteries.
    You try to fight the little bastards off and even though you close the fridge,
    you fail to close the gaping hole in your neck and pass out eventually.'
