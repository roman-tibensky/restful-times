  storyText: You won't let some leafy midget intimidate you! How dare he even try
    this feeble scare tactic on you. You yell back, trying to mimic their incoherent
    speech and shake your fork in their general direction. The yells and chants of
    the leaf folk immediately grind to a halt. Their expression is on shock and disbelief.
    They look at each other. Murmur a few incoherent sentences, then start yelling
    at each other. Then they start yelling at you, but less organized, one over the
    other with absolute disgust. You see no other option, but to double down with
    your own bit of yelling. But that was the last straw. The whole leaf clan jumps
    at you and starts attacking. They catch you by surprise. And although the leaf
    people are small, they are surprisingly strong and super nimble. Once they get
    under your clothes, you stand no chance. Must've said some horrible things to
    the little buggers.
