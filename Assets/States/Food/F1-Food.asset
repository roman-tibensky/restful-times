  storyText: Do you even have the energy for food? I suppose sleep on a full stomach
    is much nicer though. Fine, let's see if there's any fast and easy options that
    definitely won't backfire at you for wanting a quick meal
  choiceText1: 1) Eat the 100 year old mystery sandwich perfectly(?) preserved by
    the ancient fridge that somehow did not break down yet
  choiceText2: 2) Order pizza from the pizza mafia
  choiceText3: 3) Lick the mold off the ceiling. It's getting nice and ripe again.
