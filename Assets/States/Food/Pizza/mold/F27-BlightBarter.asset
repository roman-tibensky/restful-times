  storyText: You describe your current batch. You are met with a rather disappointing
    sigh. "That is barely enough to cover pizza sticks with delivery."
  choiceText1: 1) Too tired for anything else. Throw in a ranch dip and we in business.
  choiceText2: 2) Let's not... maybe delivering a package wouldn't be too much of
    a hassle
  choiceText3: 3) On second thought I feel a bit lonely. Got someone who needs to
    lay low for a couple of hours?
