  headerText: Will work for the mafia for food
  storyText: Fair enough. You are indeed running low on funds and there aren't many
    places that accept favors for their services. Sadly, you are all out of favors
    too, so before you dial Toni's, you mentally brace yourself that it will take
    some effort and/or limbs to get your food.
  choiceText1: 1) Wouldn't be the first time, let's just get it done
  choiceText2: 2) On second thought, I never ate a relic before. Ancient sandwich
    it is
  choiceText3: 3) At least the mold does not shoot at me. Lick that ceiling like you
    mean it
