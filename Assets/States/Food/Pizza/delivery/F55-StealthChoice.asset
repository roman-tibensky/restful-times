  storyText: "Your optimism is somehow both amusing and sad at the same time. Fine,
    let's see in what stupid ways you can get yourself killed.\r\n\r\nTo your credit,
    you at least try to be stealthy, try to stake out the place, look for a weak spot
    in the patrols, then crawl through one of the open windows to get inside. You
    made it into the warehouse. \r\n\r\nIt is pitch black. You make your way deeper,
    carefully putting one leg before the other, feeling your way into the warehouse.
    But at one moment, you hear someone speak up close by. Already on edge, you jump,
    bumping into some barrels, creating sound like thunder that echoes throughout
    the building, ringing in your doom. There are voices coming towards you from several
    directions, so you can't really say, what a safe way to proceed would be. Now
    what, genius?"
  choiceText1: 1) Hide! Hide! HIDE!
  choiceText2: 2) Get out, while you still can!
  choiceText3: 3) Keep calm, throw the package as a distraction. Should technically
    count as a delivery.
