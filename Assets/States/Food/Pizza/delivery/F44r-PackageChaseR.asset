  headerText: What are you? A cop?
  storyText: You're hosed either way, so you decide to go straight for a bluff. As
    loud as you can, you yell for the perpetrator to stop, as if you already knew
    who it was. You then vaguely glance at the direction you think the person that
    bumped into you went and... yup, there's a figure trying to go against the crows
    a bit harder than the rest. Not much to go on, but you got nothing else.What follows
    is the slowest chase imaginable, as both of you try to swim against the tide of
    bodies. It's slow and awkward and feels like it's taking forever. You yell at
    him a few more times and one or two good Samaritans slow him down for you as they
    try to block the perpetrator. You finally catch up, tackle him to the ground...
    and that's the last thing you remember. Somehow you wound up dead after that.
    It was so quick you don't even know what hit you.
  choiceText1: 1) Look. I shook the guy. Not the package. It's not my fault that the
    package was ON the guy, right? ... right? (GAME OVER -retry)
