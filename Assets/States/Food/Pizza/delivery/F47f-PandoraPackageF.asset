  storyText: "I know, right? I'm as surprised as you are. Let's see how long that'll
    last. You're led into a room with a bunch of people armed to the teeth. The thugs
    that brought you here address the person in charge, immediately get scolded for
    not checking the package themselves and leaving you alive for that matter. Everyone
    eyes the package, then you. \"Why don't we let our friend here open it then.\"
    Friend, huh? Considering they just wanted to kill you, you've a feeling this relationship
    might be progressing a bit too fast. But hey, still better than your prior disposition.
    Your carefully open the package and take out the content. But as soon as your
    delivery sees the light of day, you recoil in horror. Never before have you seen
    anything like it it.\r\n\r\n\"What the fuck is that?\" Asks one of the thugs.
    It's the world's fugliest plush unicorn, you think to yourself. And that seems
    to be it, really. Doesn't feel like there's anything concealed inside either. "

  choiceText3: 3) God-fucking-damn that assignment giver today. "It's... uhh... it's
    the Ugly Unicorn of Unity"
