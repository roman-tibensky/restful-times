  storyText: The thugs in the room look at each other, waiting for anyone to say anything.
    The silence was deafening. "Ah, goddamnit. I know what this is." You turn your
    gaze to a guy with a very defeated look on his face. "You know the chick I'm dating?
    I think today is our 6 week anniversary. That's gotta be from her. Definitely
    looks the part." The room is filled with relieved sighs and murmurs of "Damnit,
    Steve" and "You sure like em crazy". The guy is very apologetic and escorts you
    off the premises, giving you a small bag of cannoli and a warning to never mention
    this place to anyone ever. When you call your original contractor, saying the
    delivery is done, you're assaulted with a lot of curse words, when you describe
    the result. It's not clear where or what went wrong, but they are most certainly
    not happy. They just cannot prove it's your fault, so you get to live. For now.
    Forget the payment though.
