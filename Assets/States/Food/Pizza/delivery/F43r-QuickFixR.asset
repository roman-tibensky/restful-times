  storyText: 'Quickly, you look around and see if you can catch something out of the
    ordinary. It is a wall of people, so chances are indeed small, but hey, your employer
    is getting something out of this; whether it''s the package or your head; and
    you''re particularly attached to the latter. Your gaze falls upon a rather peculiar
    man. More like a gorilla whose face seems to be more scar than skin. He''s scanning
    the crowd as much as you are, the only differences being, he happens to have a
    package and you just happen to want one. '
