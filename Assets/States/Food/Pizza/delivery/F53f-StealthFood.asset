  headerText: Stealth and deliver
  storyText: You decided to go on a stealth mission with no prior knowledge of the
    place you were about to enter or the crew that occupied it. You haven't brought
    along any equipment and in addition, you're hampered by a package that you had
    to carry around in your hands for the most part. Now, how do you wager this goes?
  choiceText1: 1) I deliver my package, get a big reward, eat all of the pizza ever
    and live happily ever after, with no problems whatsoever?
