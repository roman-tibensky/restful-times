  storyText: "Boxes, barrels and other various containers start toppling down. You
    scramble in panic trying to avoid this avalanche of death and scurry back to safety.
    You try your best to stay out of sight in this mess. It's surprisingly easy, since
    everyone is busy panicking, putting out the fire, helping their comrades or straight
    up dying. You make it out through one of the windows and run as far as you can.\r\n\r\nWell,
    fuck. That sucked. You can't even count the ways you could've died back there.
    At least your pizza service is happy. Your first order is already waiting at home.
    With all you just went through, you don't even question how it got inside your
    apartment before you, you just wanna eat your worries away."
  choiceText1: 1) I mean, the pizza is amazing and all, but is an act of domestic
    terrorism really only worth a tab of 8 pizzas? How over-saturated has the local
    crime market gotta be for the pay to be that bad? (Objective complete!)
