  storyText: "Welp, here we are. It's dark here. It's remote. Your target is a warehouse.
    It even seems to have people patrolling it. The atmosphere is quite heavy and
    you get the feeling you're not wanted here. You're not even sure if your package
    is wanted here.\r\n"
  choiceText1: 1) What would the point of package delivery be, if they weren't expecting
    in? Just walk up to the guards and deliver the package.
  choiceText2: 2) Why was the operator so cryptic about not getting caught? Throw
    it at the guards from the shadows
  choiceText3: 3) Maybe it's supposed to be a surprise? Sneak in and place it somewhere
    obvious.
