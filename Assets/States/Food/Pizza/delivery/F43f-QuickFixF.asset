  headerText: Looking for quick fixes
  storyText: "Quickly, you look around and see if you can catch something out of the
    ordinary. The station is flooded with people, so chances are indeed small, but
    hey, your employer is getting something out of this; whether it's the package
    or your head; and you're particularly attached to the latter. Your gaze falls
    upon a young, very nervous teen, probably on a similar errand as you, nervously
    looking down at a package in his hand and then looking around the crowd. You might've
    lost your package like a dumbass, but you also seem to have the luck of one too.
    You walk up to the frightened boy, cough at him incoherently and then impatiently
    motion at the package as if he were just slowing things down in the most natural
    of exchanges. The distrust towards your \"password\" might've been strong, but
    the desire of getting rid of the package was so much stronger. He handed it over
    and just ran off. \r\n\r\nGood job. You go A package. Maybe you can play this
    out and still come out on top. Problem is... now the delivery address most likely
    doesn't match"
  choiceText1: 1) Let's go to the one I got, blame it on the instructions later. It's
    the best I can do.
