  headerText: Cough in the middle
  storyText: You decide to be as loud and obnoxious as one could be and still look
    sort of natural, while grumbling incoherently and coughing your way through the
    crowd. Although you notice you're not the only one. Must be something in the air.
    Lot of sick people everywhere. With all the similar noises, you honestly started
    to doubt you'd get anywhere with this approach. But suddenly, someone shoves a
    package in your arm, grunts at you to "get the fuck going" and disappears into
    the crowd. The package is kinda light and soft. Somehow this does not feel right.
    Not like an 8 rating at least.
  choiceText1: 1) Try to examine it further.
  choiceText2: 2) You're supposed to shake it, right?.
  choiceText3: 3) Stop faffing about and get going. The pizza won't earn itself
