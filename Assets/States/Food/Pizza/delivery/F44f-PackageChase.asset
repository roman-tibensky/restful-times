  headerText: What are you? A cop?
  storyText: You're hosed either way, so you decide to go straight for a bluff. As
    loud as you can, you yell for the perpetrator to stop, as if you already knew
    who it was. You then vaguely glance at the direction you think the person that
    bumped into you went and... yup, there's a figure trying to go against the crowd
    a bit harder than the rest. Not much to go on, but you got nothing else. What
    follows is the slowest chase imaginable, as both of you try to swim against the
    tide of bodies. It's slow and awkward and feels like it's taking forever. You
    yell at him a few more times and one or two good Samaritans slow him down for
    you as they try to block the perpetrator. You finally catch up, tackle him to
    the ground, get your package back and promptly disappear before the cops show
    up. Seems to be the same package even. What luck!
  choiceText1: 1) Okay, that was enough excitement for one day, let's just deliver
    the package.
