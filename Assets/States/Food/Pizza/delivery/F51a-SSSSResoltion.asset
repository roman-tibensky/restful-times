  storyText: The guy in charge went silent again. Paced around the room for a bit.
    None of the other guys dared to speak. "Fine... fine. Tell our boss we're willing
    to talk." Okay? Something tells you this wasn't really what you were paid to do
    here, but refusing sounded like a bad idea. You go out for some fresh air. You
    call up your assignment giver. You explain the situation. Then you explain it
    again. Then one more time for good measure, as the guy at the other end of the
    line was still processing what the ever-loving hell you just did. Eventually,
    things were sorted out. The two parties agreed to meet. You were paid your fee
    and when you returned home, a fresh pizza was waiting for you on the dinner table.
