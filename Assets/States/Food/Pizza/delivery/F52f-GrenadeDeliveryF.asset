  headerText: Package in the hole!
  storyText: You sneak up close. You, shake the package as instructed, take your aim
    and throw. The package glides beautifully through the air and lands with a slight
    bounce at the feet of one of the patrolling men. All in all a perfect throw. Too
    bad that the gentlemen on the receiving end were not as appreciative of your efforts.
    Without hesitation, they opened fire at the direction the package came from. Before
    you could run away, a stray bullet was delivered as feedback to the back of your
    head.
