    try to - BUMP - find it, since it was in your hands just a second ago and OH MY
    GOD, WHERE DID THE PACKAGE GO. Took only a split second. Distracted by your curiosity,
    you let your guard down and now someone in this enormous mass of people decided
    they want it more than you do. This is a fucking disaster..
