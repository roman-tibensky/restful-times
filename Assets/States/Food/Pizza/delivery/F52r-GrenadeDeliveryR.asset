  headerText: Package in the hole!
  storyText: "You sneak up close. You, shake the package as instructed, take your
    aim and throw. The package glides beautifully through the air, lands at the feet
    of one of the patrolling men AND EXPLODES IN A SLOPE OF FIERY FURY! HOLY SHIT!
    The explosion knocks you back and off your feet. There's fire and a giant hole
    where the entrance of the warehouse used to be. You hear screams. Debris is falling
    from the sky. Some of it hits you in your back and arms, but you don't really
    have time to complain. You make the most of the confusion and destruction that
    you caused to get the ever-loving hell out of there. Fuck. Never doing an 8-rating
    delivery again, that's for sure. \n\nYou somehow make your way home. On the way,
    you call to report on your assignment and prepare yourself to yell at the operator,
    however, the guy has the nerve to yell at you instead! Says the package didn't
    make it into the building. Says that the way you handled it, you delivered a message
    at best. He downgrades your reward to a level 3 of pizza sticks. Can't even have
    all the servings in one go either. But hey, free choice of dressing at least?"
  choiceText1: 1)  I went through explosions for a few bits of bread?! Are you for
