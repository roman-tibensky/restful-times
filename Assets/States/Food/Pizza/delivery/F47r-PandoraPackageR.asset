  storyText: "I know, right? I'm as surprised as you are. Let's see how long that'll
    last. You're led into a room with a bunch of people armed to the teeth. The thugs
    that brought you here address the person in charge, immediately get scolded for
    not checking the package themselves and leaving you alive for that matter. Everyone
    eyes the package, then you. \"Why don't we let our friend here open it then.\"
    Friend, huh? Considering they just wanted to kill you, you've a feeling this relationship
    might be progressing a bit too fast, but hey, still better than your prior disposition.
    You carefully open the package and take out the content. \r\n\r\nHonestly, it's
    not much to look at. Inside the package, was just another metal box, but without
    any apparent way of opening it.\r\n\r\n\"What the fuck is that?\" Asks one of
    the thugs. Indeed, a man who's not afraid to ask the hard hitting questions. No
    doubt, he'll go far in life."
