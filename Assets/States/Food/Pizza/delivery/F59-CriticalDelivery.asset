  storyText: "Trying to look as natural as possible, you decided the best approach
    would be to pretend you're on a call with someone. You yelled in your phone, complaining
    about a play you supposedly saw. Where every actor was sick. And every third word
    was obscured by coughing. You spoke as loud as you could, in order to be heard
    by your imaginary friend on the end of the line and, more importantly, by someone
    who'd hopefully like to dispose of a parcel maybe? And someone indeed did. They
    came up, placed a package in your hands. Snarled at you to be careful and made
    sure they put as much distance between you and them as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nCool,
    first step done. The package is fairly sturdy and kinda heavy. Hopefully it's
    the right one too?"
  choiceText1: 1) Try to examine it further.
  choiceText2: 2) You're supposed to shake it, right?.
  choiceText3: 3) Stop faffing about and get going. The pizza won't earn itself
