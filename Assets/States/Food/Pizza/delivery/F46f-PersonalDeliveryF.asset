  storyText: Tonight has been a mess. You're not sure if the assignment giver was
    just bored or too stressed to function properly, but the instructions your were
    given, were just the worst. It's usually not this bad, but you kinda lost faith
    in anything he said and you just wanna go home without jumping through any more
    hoops. You walk up to them as casually as one can, when seeing the other party
    reach for their guns. Slowly, you lift your hands up, holding the package up.
    The guards look at one another unsure what to do with you. "Package delivery?"
    You try to to offer a hint. You're promptly searched and shoved inside and led
    deeper into the facility.
