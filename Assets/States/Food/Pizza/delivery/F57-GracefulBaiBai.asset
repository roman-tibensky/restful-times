  storyText: "Well, you already alerted people to your presence, no point in trying
    to be too subtle anymore. You turn around and run towards what you think is the
    way back. Turns out that it wasn't. It was a bunch of boxes. And you very confidently
    rammed into particularly a large, unbalanced stack. It came hurling down and made
    you as flat as the pizza you were so desperately working for. I guess that's one
    way to solve this situation.\r\n"
