  storyText: "Mixing business and survival? Kinda admirable, but mostly just insane.
    But not like you can make the situation any worse at this point. Maybe it could
    even help your predicament. You bite your lip, shake the package and throw it
    with all your might into the darkness. \r\n\r\nYou wait for the thud of the package
    to distract the people in the warehouse, but instead, the whole building is enveloped
    by a fiery light and you get swept off your feet by a giant shock wave, as a huge
    explosion shakes the warehouse. "
