  headerText: Shaking things up with Shakespeare
  storyText: "Well, you certainly gave it a try. Downloaded the whole act on your
    phone and in the most monotone, insecure voice possible started to stumble and
    cough your way through the massive amount of text no sane person would ever use
    as a password. Good job. You were so conspicuous that even regular bystanders
    started avoiding you, creating a hole in the crowd, with you in the middle like
    an island of Crazy. Didn't take long for the cops to escort you off the premises.
    Pretty spectacular as far as failures go, if I do say so myself. Doubt you'll
    be given the option to order pizza ever again. \r\n\r\nOn a more positive note,
    people mistook you for a hobo! They threw enough money at your performance for
    you to at least grab a bagel before you head home."
  choiceText1: 1) A whole bagel you say? Might need to do these performances more
    often (Objective complete-ish)
