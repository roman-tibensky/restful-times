  storyText: "Too late for doubts now. Your eyes meet. He immediately figures out
    your intent. He waves his hairy paw, motioning for you to come to him. Your freaked
    out face must make you look like you're doing this for the first time ever, so
    the gorilla decided this transaction is now under its supervision. You awkwardly
    make your way to him and then stare helplessly back wondering what to tell him
    without aping out.\r\n\"Well?\" he snarls impatiently. You kinda just murmur something
    under your breath. \"It's so loud here, I can't hear shit! Ugh... let's just pretend
    those were word and I'm technically expecting words,\" he pushes his package on
    you. \"Now fucking hurry.\"\r\n\r\nGood job. You got A package. Maybe you can
    play this out and still come out on top. Problem is... now the delivery address
    most likely doesn't match."
