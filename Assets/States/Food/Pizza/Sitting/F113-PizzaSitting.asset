  storyText: Yeah, you're letting strangers into your house for a couple of hours.
    But the pizza tab will usually be covered for days to come, if the target is good.
    The jobs aren't even that unsafe most of the time. This system, after all, exists

    Keep him with you until our driver arrives and takes him elsewhere. Mess this
    up and we mess you up." A fortnight pizza level target? Fuck. Perhaps I spoke
    too soon
  choiceText1: 1) Where's my gun?
  choiceText2: 2) Is that a VIP? Should I tidy up?
