  storyText: Before you can even finish your thought, the door bell introduces a small
    heart attack into your system. You curse a bit under your breath as you get your
    bearings and invite the walking food stamp in. I mean guest. You're getting so
    distracted by your hunger, you can't really think straight. But it's time to get
