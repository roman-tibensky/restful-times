  storyText: Nah, not touching this with a 10-foot pole. You let him process things
    on his own. He didn't finish before his ride came for him though. He bawled all
    the way to the car. Thankfully, your employer could not care less. Your payment
    was delicious and eating felt all the better after all the alcohol you ingested.
    All in all, a smooth ride with a nice payoff
