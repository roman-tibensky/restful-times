  headerText: Not getting creepy at all
  storyText: Your stare is relentless. your guest is getting nervous... well, even
    more nervous. "H-hey. What's that stare for." Ah, maybe your methods started producing
    results. "Y-you could say at least something, you know."
  choiceText1: 1) This is getting a bit impolite. At least offer him a drink.
  choiceText2: 2) Staring is getting kinda tiresome. You could use a smoke break.
  choiceText3: 3) Words are for the weak. Real men just meaningfully gaze at each
    other.
