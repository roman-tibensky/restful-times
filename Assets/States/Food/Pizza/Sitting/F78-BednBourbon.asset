  storyText: You lead your new friend into the living room, show him the couch. He
    just kinda slides onto it with a weary sigh. Looks comfortable enough. You go
    back to the kitchen to fetch some more drinks. But when you come back, your guest
    is gone without a trace. You frown, knock back your drink and start searching.
    He's nowhere to be found. The door leading outside is still locked. There's no
    body-shaped hole in the pavement under your balcony, so he didn't jump off. He's
    not hiding in any closet. He's just gone. You don't really have an explanation.
    Sadly, the people who come to pick your guest up don't seem to care about your
    situation. They make you disappear too
