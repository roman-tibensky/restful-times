  headerText: Sandwich served with a side of suffering
  storyText: "You sigh, leave your drink alone and come take a look. Looks like and
    ordinary sandwich, really. You look up at your guest with a rather skeptic expression.
    He gives you this \"I know what I saw\" look back and leans closer to the sandwich.\r\n...
    Holy shit, it twitched! \"What the fu-\" You were not allowed to finish that sentence.
    The sandwich burst open. A half a dozen blurred green shapes, too fast for you
    to recognize exploded into two directions - the two humans staring at the sandwich.
    Before you could even react they latched onto you and started stabbing the hell

    unconscious."
  choiceText1: '1) What the ever-loving fucking-fuckity-frack was that! You eat the
    sandwich, not the other way around!
