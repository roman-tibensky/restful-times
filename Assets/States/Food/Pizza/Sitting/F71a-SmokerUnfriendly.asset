  storyText: '... until your door breaks down in a violent crash and four armed men
    burst in. Your guest screams and looks for a way to escape, but you''re both trapped
    on the balcony. The only exit is to plunge your face into the pavement 10 stories
    below you. You don''t even get the chance to make that decision, before two of
    the guys shoot you in the chest. You slump against the railing. The last thing
    you see before your life fades away,  is your guest being dragged off kicking
    and screaming. It seems while you were watching the city, it was watching back.
    And decided to check out your guest a bit early.'
  choiceText1: 1) Are you in any way implying that parading a high risk target on
    the balcony was a bad idea? That doesn't sound right (GAME OVER - retry)
