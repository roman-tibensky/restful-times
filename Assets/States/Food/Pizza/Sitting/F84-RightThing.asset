  storyText: "\"Hey now.It's okay. It's fine. I'm... uhh... sure you can fix this
    somehow. Or make up for it. something.\"\r\n\r\nThe your guest fell silent for
    a bit. \"I see... I guess you're right. Not much else can be done. Thank you.
    You are too wise.\"\rThere you go. Another drunk satisfied with the power of non-specific
    replies. It took a bit of effort, but he slowly stood up and with an uneasy step
    made his way to the balcony. Then, with an \"I'm sorry\" the bastard threw himself
    off! What the fuck!\r\n\r\nThere was very little you could do in response. You
    look down and see his body sprawled on the pavement. It doesn't take long for
    the mafia to realize what happened. You try to run, but they find you faster than
    you could find a taxi. For a sense of poetic justice, they decide you can take
    a trip from the same balcony as your former guest. At least the view is familiar."
