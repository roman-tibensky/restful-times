  storyText: "Your guest sadly finds very little humor in the situation. The explosion
    sobered him up in an instant. He jumped and ran for the door before you could
    even recover from the shock. You blinked and he was gone. Once you made it out
    of the building, you couldn't find hide nor hair of the guy. You returned home,
    biting your lip, knowing full well, you were hosed if anything were to happen
    to him.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour passed before someone rang your doorbell. It was
    one of the regular couriers. He told you that you got lucky. The guy was found
    and was unharmed. But afterwards things got ridiculously complicated because of
    you. You were awarded the Pizza Sticks of Shame and a lifetime ban from babysitting"
