  storyText: Well, needles to say your new friend is just a teeny tiny bit on edge.
    He's a scrawny twig in his late thirties. Neatly dressed and neatly trimmed. Has
    a bit of a weaselly look to him, but it's largely overpowered by the expression
    of abject terror he chose to wear this evening. He clings to a rather expensive-looking
    briefcase, is paler than death and shacking like he just ran inside a freezer
    in a swimsuit. He blurts out a "H-hi" and even that takes about three tries. This
    might be a job, but you're kinda just starting to feel bad for the guy. You slowly
    nod a hello back and wonder what to do with your new freaked out friend
  choiceText1: 1) Just get the poor sod a drink.
  choiceText2: 2) You two need to go grab some fresh air and a smoke to calm down
    his nerves. He'll be unbearable like this
  choiceText3: 3) Stare at him awkwardly some more to see what he'll do
