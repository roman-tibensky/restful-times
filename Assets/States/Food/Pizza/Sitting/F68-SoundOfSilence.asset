  storyText: "Your silent words seem to have hit a nerve. You tilt your head in confusion.
    It's not like the caretaker ever gets to hear the story of the person they have
    to hide beforehand. You have no idea what this walking meal voucher is talking
    about. But hell if you're stopping. This is about as much as you feel like investing
    into this conversation. Everything else would mean effort on your part.\r\n\r\nYour
    conversation partner is not taking this as well as you however. \"Stop giving
    me that look!\" He's getting quite antsy. \"I tried preventing this, okay? I tried!
    What else could I have possibly done?\""
  choiceText1: 1) Seem like you'll be a while. Choose this only if you mind me grabbing
    a beer from your kitchen instead. I'm thirsty.
  choiceText2: 2) I mean, it's not like you need me here. You literally just stare
    at a guy and won't stop. Not even for a smoke.
  choiceText3: 3) Pretend I put some eye pun here, I don't even care anymore
