    look at this guy. So lost, helpless, soon-to-be-drunk-of-his-buttocks. Your consciousness
    is telling you to ease his pain at least a little bit. Fine... You decide to be
    a proper host for once.\r\n \"Lemme getcha something,\" you sigh, open the fridge
    and grab a plate with the sandwich on it. You notion to the kitchen table and
    have your guest seated there and serve him the sandwich.\r\n\r\nYou turn around
