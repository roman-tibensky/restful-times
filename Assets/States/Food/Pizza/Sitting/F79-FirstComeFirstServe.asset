  storyText: 'You lead your new friend into the living room, then slid onto the couch
    to assert your dominance. It seems however, your attack on the couch was a bit
    too effective. You dove in head first and buried yourself deep into the cushions
    upon landing. Like, really, really deep. It feels like your whole body was jammed
    into the depths of the cushions. You can''t even get out on your own. '
