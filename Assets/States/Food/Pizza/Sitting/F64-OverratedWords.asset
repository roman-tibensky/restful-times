  storyText: Yeah, you can't really say you're into the idea of striking up a conversation
    if it's at all avoidable. Besides. This freaked out fella is kinda fascination
    to watch. You don't think you've ever seen somebody this freaked out in your life.
    The drunken bear incident included. Don't you kind of just feel like observing
    for a while? For science?
  choiceText1: 1) Ain't that kinda creepy though? At least offer him a drink or something.
  choiceText2: 2) Science sounds boring. Just grab a smoke and calm the guy down
  choiceText3: 3) Hell yeah! Science!
