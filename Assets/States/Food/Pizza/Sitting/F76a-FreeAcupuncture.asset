  storyText: "You decided you're not keen enough to open the fridge to find out what
    just happened. Your immediate problem, was that your guest was not doing so hot.
    And in return, you won't be either when they pick him up. You led the guy away
    to the safety of the living room and spent the rest of your time together taking
    out toothpicks and splinters out of his arm.\r\n\r\nWhen the mafia came to pick
    him up, you got berated for damaging the goods. And despite your attempts of claiming
    that repeatedly stabbing your skin with needles was healthy and the crushed bones
    were but a slight side effect, the only payment you got from the job was half
    of an old dried out pizza. He cost you more in alcohol than you gained in food.
    Fuck."
