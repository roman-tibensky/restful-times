  storyText: "Although you've been playing the silent treatment game throughout the
    night, this question has taken you by surprise a bit. You're not entirely sure
    if your current approach would work in this particular instance, but you're kinda
    committed at this point. Not much you can do but see it through - by saying jack
    shit.\r\nThe dude sighs again: \"I know, I know. I need to clean this mess up
    on my own. No point in involving you further.\" He sighs again, takes out a phone
    from his jacket. \"Can I have some privacy please? Have a drink or a smoke or
    whatever, I'm afraid this will take a while.\" You decide to do both at once,
    just to spite the narrator, WHO WAS JUST TRYING TO DO HIS JOB, MIND YOU."
  choiceText1: 1) I can give you the silent treatment too, you know, don't you start
