  storyText: "Yes, you have food. But that was your food. The agreement was to provide
    shelter, not a five star service to this knob-head. You're sure he'd rob you blind
    if he could while he's at it. You grunt a \"help yourself\" and motion at the
    fridge, while you go back to pouring drinks.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, you hear a painful
    scream. You turn around with a startled twitch and see the guy desperately keeping
    the fridge door closed with his back, while holding his right hand. Said hand
    looks like a bleeding cactus for some reason. There's countless needle-like things
    stabbed all over his palm. Looks painful. Sounds painful too. All he can do, is
    wheeze \"what the fuck was that\" in agony over and over again. "
  choiceText1: 1) Yeah, I'm not looking inside to answer that question.
  choiceText2: 2) Are you kidding me? Is he too dumb to take a sandwich out of a fridge?
  choiceText3: 3) Shit, the merchandise is damaged!
