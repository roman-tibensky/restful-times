  storyText: You went to the balcony and just stared out into the city traffic. It
    was loud as per usual. You couldn't really hear much from inside your apartment.
    You only know that your guest was on the phone with various people most of the
    time, but something was telling you it was best that you didn't know what was
    going on anyway. You were half-way through your fourth cigarette when the doorbell
    rang. Thugs from your food provider came in... along with people that you've never
    seen before. They brought you your food and took away the weirdo. He kept thanking
    you for what felt like ages before he finally left. To the thugs' inquisitive
    gazes you could only shrug. Nobody knows what the hell that was about.
  choiceText1: 1) Wonder if I could charge therapy as an additional service. (Objective
    complete!)
