  storyText: "\"Is not like I wanted this, you know,\" your guest sort of slid off
    the beanbag onto the floor, using it more as a cushion than anything. Staring
    at the ceiling, he talked to himself more than anything.\r\n\r\n\"But my old man
    would not see. That insane gap in power. I know... it looks like we have more
    manpower. But that stupid barter system. It's like the Pizza mafia has infinite
    people. Cause who doesn't want a fucking pizza, amiright?\" He notions at you

    our ways. Oldschool approach is just gonna get us killed. I just... I just wanted
    them to see that. I just needed them to see that. But no one would!\""
