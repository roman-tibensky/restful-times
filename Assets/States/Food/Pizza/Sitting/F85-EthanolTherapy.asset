  storyText: "\"Look, why don't you call your old man then. Sounds like you still
    can from what you're saying.\"\r\nYou, sir, are a bad drinking buddy. I can't
    \ say whether this is worse than letting someone drunk-text their ex, only because
    no one invented a category of \"drunk call your dad to listen to him potentially
    be assassinated\" yet.\r\n\r\nYou don't even have the time to consider saying
    that was a joke before your victim starts talking on the phone. He yells at someone
    on the other line and keeps doing so until he's interrupted with an explosion
    so loud, you could hear it through the phone yourself. \r\n\r\n"
