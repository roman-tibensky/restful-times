  storyText: "You hear faint screams from somewhere far far away, as someone grabs
    your legs and starts pulling you out. Somehow you got dragged out by your very
    hysterical guest. He started spewing some non-sense about the couch literally
    chewing on you and no matter what you did, he would not calm down. He wouldn't
    touch anything, he wouldn't drink anymore either. He just stood in the corridor,
    waiting for his ride. \r\n\r\nWhen people came to pick your guest up and saw the
    state he was in, they weren't exactly what one would call thrilled. They almost
    killed you on the spot, claiming he was completely unusable. Your pizzas were
    cancelled, you were only left with a few pizza sticks the driver used to beat
    you over the head with. You still have no idea what happened. Your guest was indeed
    drunk, but not drunk enough to think furniture would eat people though... was
    he?"
  choiceText1: 1) Food might taste better when  it's tender, but using my head to
    do the tenderizing is a bit much... (Objective complete-ish)
