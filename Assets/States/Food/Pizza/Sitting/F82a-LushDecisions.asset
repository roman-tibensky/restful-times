  storyText: Well, good luck with that. For all you know, there's a drunk future mafia
    boss crying on your floor, babbling something about fratricide. You feel... conflicted
    to say the least. On one hand, he looks absolutely miserable. On the other hand,
    getting more deeply involved into mafia business is never a good idea. And talking
    to drunk people if you're not on their level has wildly varying results at the
    best of times. But with how things stand, you gotta do at least SOMETHING.
  choiceText1: 1) Actually, just let the poor guy have his moment. He'll feel better
    once he lets it out
  choiceText2: 2) Give a generic reply. Drunks find their own meaning in everything
    anyway.
  choiceText3: 3) Look, as awkward as this is, it's also a little bit funny. Why not
    see what happens if he calls his dad.
