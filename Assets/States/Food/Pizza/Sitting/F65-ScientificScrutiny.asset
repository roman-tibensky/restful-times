  storyText: 'You''re both kinda just standing there. You didn''t even move from the
    foyer. Your guest stares at you in his near-to-nervous-breakdown state, hoping
    to find some comfort in the presence of another human being; someone who was literally
    put in charge of his safety. His eyes, full of hope that whatever madness pursues
    him would be dispelled by your presence, in the safety of your home. You can see
    that desperate hope for you to say something - ANYTHING - to take this tension
    away. Even a simple "You okay?" maybe. But you offer but one thing in return:
    A cold. Blank. Stare.'
  choiceText1: 1) Okay, at this point he's kinda starting to look pathetic. Just give
    him a drink and sit him down somewhere.
  choiceText2: 2) Okay, that was fun, but I doubt we'll get more out of him. Let's
    take him out for some fresh air and cancery smokes
  choiceText3: 3) Look. I wanna get at least one interesting reaction out of the fucker.
    Keep staring.
