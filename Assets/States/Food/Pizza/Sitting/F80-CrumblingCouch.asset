  storyText: "You lead your new friend into the living room, then point at the bean
    bag in the corner. An odd choice, considering there's a huge, comfortable  looking
    couch. Your guest seems to think so too, giving you a confused glare.\r\n\r\n\"Couch
    is old and springs keep poking out. You CAN sit on it, if you wish, but you'll
    most likely rip a few holes in that nice suit of yours,\" you bluff without a
    hint of doubt.\r\n\r\nYour guest sighs a drunken Oh of Understanding and slumps
    into the beanbag, drunkenly wiggling himself comfortable. You offer another drink.
    At this point, he just downs it automatically, starring into oblivion with that
    buzzed look in eyes. He's getting sauced nice and proper. The question now is,
    what kind of drunk is he.\r\n\r\n\"You... you know. Some nasty shit is going down
    tonight.... Is all my fault too... Did you know?\""
