  storyText: You offer your guest barely a shot. He downs it before you can even say
    a cheers. Still shaking like a leaf though. Guess he can hold his alcohol better
    than you thought, if nothing else.
  choiceText1: 1) Maybe he just needs a smoke to calm his nerves rather than a drink.
  choiceText2: 2) Well, maybe the lad knows how to drink after all. Let's pour him
    a proper one this time
  choiceText3: 3) Screw it, he's getting his own bottle, we're drinking like men!
