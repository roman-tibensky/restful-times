  storyText: "Through the haze that the world currently is, you hear the doorbell
    ring. Pickup's here. You drag your guest out of the bath tub and kinda shove him
    towards the door. When you manage to open it, you're greeted with.... words? Some
    words. Context is for sober people. The figures that stand there at least look
    familiar? Hard  to say. They scoop up the nigh liquid-state human they left with
    you, exchange him for a pizza and leave.\r\n\r\nYou'd eat, but you really do feel
    like shit. Taking a slice up to your mouth is an ordeal and a half. You chew a
    little bit of your food, but that's about all you can manage. Time to call it
    a night. Any other action would be a waste of time."
