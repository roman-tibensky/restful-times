  storyText: "Well, if nothing else, you can say some color returned into the weasel's
    cheeks. That's a start. Yet, there still seems to be something on his mind. He
    gives you an apologetic look and speaks with an uncertain voice:\r\n\n\"Sorry
    to ask, but you wouldn't happen to have any food? This is gonna hit hard and I
    haven't eaten all day.\""
  choiceText1: 1) I'll be a good guest and serve him the sandwich in the fridge. I'm
    getting quite a bit of food out of this anyways
  choiceText2: 2) Sounds like a hassle. The fridge is over there, he can get whatever
    is inside.
  choiceText3: 3) And avoid seeing the guy being blind drunk? What a missed opportunity
    that would be.
