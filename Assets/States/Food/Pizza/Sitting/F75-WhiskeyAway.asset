  storyText: "Yeah, your guest needs to wash that stress down thoroughly. You start
    with a tall glass 2/3 full and we'll see how you go from there. Your guest eagerly
    accepts your offering and chugs half of it down straight away. Not bad.\r\n\r\nSeems
    the alcohol agrees with him thus far. He started shacking a bit less. The familiar
    burn in one's chest spreading though one's body, relaxing one's muscles, dulling
    one's thoughts - sometimes that's all it takes to reset a person, help them calm
    down, gather their thoughts together at least for a lil bit.\r\n\r\nYour guest
    seems to be be reaching the very end of the gathering process. You wonder what
    the conclusion might be.\r\n\"Sorry to ask, but you wouldn't happen to have any
    food? This is gonna hit hard and I haven't eaten all day.\""
