  storyText: "Yeah, your guest needs to wash that stress down thoroughly. You start
    with a 2/3 full glass and we'll see how you go from there. Your guest eagerly
    accepts your offering and chugs half of it down straight away. Not bad.\r\n\r\nSeems

    burn in one's chest spreading though one's body, relaxing one's muscles, dulling
    one's thoughts - sometimes that's all it takes to reset a person, help them calm
    down and gather their thoughts at least a little bit.\r"
