    WITH THIS INTERROGATION!\" You literally haven't said a single word to this guy
    in your life, let alone ask him questions. But it doesn't feel like you could
    stop him at this point even if you'd try. He started nervously pacing back and
    forth and every time he face'd you, he'd try and make some sort of defense. \"I
    tried everything.\" \"Nobody would listen.\" \"I don't WANT people to die\" Yeesh,
    that last one does not sound very optimistic. Then the man stopped. He exhaled
    a deep defeated sigh. Whatever the argument was, I think you won? \"Fine! What
    would YOU have done in my place?\""

    why this option is here.
