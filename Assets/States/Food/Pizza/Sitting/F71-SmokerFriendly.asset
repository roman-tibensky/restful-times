  storyText: "The atmosphere here is so stiff, you can't handle it anymore. You notion
    your guest to follow you. Startled, he complies and follows you to the balcony.
    You offer him a smoke. He hesitates, but takes it in the end. You both lean on
    the railing and take in the sounds of the city. They aren't very pleasant to be
    fair. Mostly honking cars and the occasional cursing. But this is where you grew
    up, those sounds are in your blood. As you stand there enjoying your cigarette,
    you look over to your guest. You can tell he's very much the same. He calmed down
    considerably, pumping his lungs full with nicotine and staring at the city lights.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\"
    he finally spoke, \"I really needed this.\" You nod and hand him one more cigarette.
    He gladly takes it. You both, just chill without another word on the balcony,
    staring at the world..."
