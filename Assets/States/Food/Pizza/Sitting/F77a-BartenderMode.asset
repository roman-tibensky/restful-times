  storyText: "\"Hey, isn't that always the case though?\" You reply as you top off
    his drink. \r\n\r\n\"Oh, fuck off. What kinda non-sentiment is that,\" your guest
    snarls and downs his drink in one go. The alcohol was clearly taking over his
    brain cells and loosening his tongue at this point. \"No sorry. Not your problem.
    Just... just let me sit down, I'm getting tipsy.\" He may have said that. But
    he's still sipping on the next shot you poured."
  choiceText1: 1) Sit him on the couch in the living room.
  choiceText2: 2) Option 1 is clearly wrong. That couch has not been used since it
    was bought. He's not taking its first time. Just sit him on a bean bag or something
  choiceText3: 3) Just take over the couch before he does. Who cares where he'll sit
    afterwards.
