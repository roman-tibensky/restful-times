  storyText: "The night is young and the only way you gonna tolerate this bundle of
    nerves is to bond like proper men. In other words, drink so hard, you both forget
    that you ever met. And since you're feeling fancy, your guest gets his very own,
    brand new bottle. Not like you intend to stop after one anyway.\r\n\r\nYour guest
    takes it, hesitantly stares at the hooch for but a second before he, as a true
    enlightened brother, proclaims \"fuck it\" and starts chugging.\r\n\r\nSafe to
    say, you don't remember much after that. When you come to your senses, you're
    hanging from the balcony by your belt. You feel like shit. Kitchen's a mess. There's
    a traffic cone stuck in the couch deeper than should be physically possible. There's
    a bra stuffed in a mixer chilling on your bed. You know very little of what happened,
    but you know for certain no one came in our out of the apartment, so what the
    fuck?"
  choiceText1: 1) Look, if you don't shred a bra in a mixer, can you even call it
    a party?
