  storyText: 'Some people might find it embarrassing that they have their favorite
    fast food on speed dial. You, on the other hand, have the local mafia on speed
    dial, just so that you can order pizza. You sigh and promise to yourself to fix
    that one day. But today you''re taking advantage of your habits. Someone picks
    up and before you even get to introduce yourself, he goes: "Your tab''s run out.
    You do not have the cash. You know the drill. What do you offer." It''s the customer
    service that just keeps you coming back to Toni''s, isn''t it.'
  choiceText1: 1) Package delivery
  choiceText2: 2) Shelter for some poor soul in your house for a couple of hours.
  choiceText3: 3) Offer your mold harvest early.
