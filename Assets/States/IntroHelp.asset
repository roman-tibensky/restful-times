  storyText: "Good evening and welcome home! In case you forgot who you are, you're
    a private detective! And you're dead tired. You should just do your best to rest
    up a bit. To do that, you either click the choice you want, or press the number
    of the choice you want. \n\nSometimes you die, that's just part of life. But since
    this is a game, if you complete any objectives, you don't have to repeat those
    until you finish your run. Now relaaaaaaaax, m'dude!"
  choiceText1: 1) So I just click this yellow text or press 1? Sounds straight forward
    enough. Let's get started!
