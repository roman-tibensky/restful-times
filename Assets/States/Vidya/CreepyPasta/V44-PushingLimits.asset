  storyText: Yeah, games should stay on one side of the screen, while you safely chill
    on the other. This is an invasion of your personal space that should not be tolerated.
    You yell and charge the ghost lady. She yells back and tries to brace herself.
    You tackle the apparition with all your might. However, when you clashed into
    her, this turned out to be a less than perfect plan. Her body gave way a bit too
    easily and you struggle to keep your balance. At the same time, desperate to stay
    on this side, the ghost grabs at you and as she falls back, partially pulls you
    into the monitor. Now you're stuck with your head and right arm inside the ghost
    world.
