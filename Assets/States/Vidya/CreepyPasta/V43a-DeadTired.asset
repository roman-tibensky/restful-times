  storyText: You carefully edge closer trying not to startle her. You gently poke
    her, but you get no response. You carefully try to pull on her to face you. No
    resistance. Her head smoothly slides to face you with a horrified, dead look in
    her eyes and a huge bleeding gash across her throat. That... wasn't there before,
    was it? To add to your confusion, you're suddenly treated to a sharp pain in your
    back. It forces you to your knees, then someone pushes your face to the ground.
    You try to look up only to see the faces of the teenagers you played as staring
    back at you with condescending grins. Then before you can even ask why, they proceed
    to stab you until your consciousness leaves you.

    playthrough, isn't it. (GAME OVER - retry)
