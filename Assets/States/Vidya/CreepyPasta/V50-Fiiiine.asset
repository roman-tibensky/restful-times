  storyText: Fine, but don't think this conversation is over! You look over to the
    monitor only to be met with 5 very displeased gazes. They definitely don't look
    as pleasant as they did while you were the one picking choices for em. There's
    this bloody-thirsty hint to the glint in their eye that doesn't give you much
    hope for a peaceful resolution. You were about to address the menace, but before
    you could utter a single word, the walls start screaming at you "GIVE HER BACK!
    GIVE! HER! BACK!"
  choiceText1: 1) Okay, okay! The wall-bullying is just too much, they can have her!
  choiceText2: 2) Look, how about a few cold brewskis instead?
  choiceText3: 3) I'll trade her for a pineapple pizza?
