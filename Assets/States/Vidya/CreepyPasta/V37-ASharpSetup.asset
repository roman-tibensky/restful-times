  storyText: 'Welp, fine. The game never really stated how you''re supposed to fight
    back, so you might as well try and stab the ethereal and pretend it''s a good
    idea. You set up the teens, you lure the ghostly thing into an improvised trap.

    the crap out of an already dead person. Are you really certain this is what you
    want to do? '
