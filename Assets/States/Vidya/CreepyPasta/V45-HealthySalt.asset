  storyText: Salt? Against ghosts? I... I guess? Worth  a try I suppose? Fine! You
    run to the kitchen! You grab the salt, pour it in a large cup and run back to
    your computer! You arrive just in time to see the ghost make it out. She slid
    from your table onto the floor and through heavy gasps and swallowing tried to
    get her bearings. Now's your chance! With a resolute " Be gone!" You throw all
    of the salt onto the apparition. Direct hit in her face too. She screams, recoils
    in pain and... starts.... crying? She isn't melting away or anything like that,
    she's just crying " Huah ih wong wih hoo" and trying to get all of the salt out
    of her eyes?
