  storyText: "Look, sometimes, it's good to check these things. Sometimes, it's just
    nice to know that your primary decision can be overturned. That, just because
    you made a mistake, nothing terrible is going to happen. To have a bit of a safety
    net in this harsh game we call life. To know that someone is there to catch you
    should you err from time to time.\r\n\r\nBut this is not such a case. Apparently,
    while I was giving you a pep talk, the ghost disappeared and murdered all the
    kids. Nothing left but five bloody stains and a game over screen. Restarting your
    game isn't helping either. It just goes back to the same Game Over screen. You
    search for save files, but you find none. So... uhhhh... My bad?"
