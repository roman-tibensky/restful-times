  storyText: You tried to turn off the game, even your computer in general, but the
    scene just kept going even though no power was flowing into your rig anymore.
    Only as the victim slowly lost consciousness did the anguished cries echoing through
    your home start to die down. The maniacal cackle of the teenagers and the blood
    flow from the walls did not relent though. The sharp voices pierced your brain
    as the little monsters kept stabbing and cutting at the lifeless body with morbid
    glee until all that remained was a bloody unrecognizable mess. Only when the game
    turned itself off did the haunting sounds slowly start to dissipate and all the
    blood from the walls disappeared god knows where. Seems like you've won? I guess?
    It stopped, so that's a good thing, right? Man, yard sale games can be fricken
    weird sometimes.
  choiceText1: 1) Modern entertainment might be a bit too much for me really. I'm
    sticking to Solitaire from now on (Objective complete!)
