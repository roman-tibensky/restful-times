  headerText: Self-defense butchery
  storyText: It's getting harder and harder to watch the situation. Every moment,
    you expect the ghost to retaliate, to defend herself somehow to... do something
    at least! But all she did do was plead and scream, and even the pleas had to completely
    give way to the cries of anguish the more this massacre went on. And the screams
    were LOUD. Your whole apartment shook as the very walls echoed the girl's pain
    and the mad cackling of her assailants. It only got louder as teenagers became
    more unhinged. Even the walls started to bleed more as the torture became more
    and more visceral. And you were caught in the middle of this assault on the senses
    and there was very little you could do about it.
