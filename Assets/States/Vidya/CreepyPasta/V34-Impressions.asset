  storyText: The game turns out to be a visual novel type thing. It tells the story
    about a group of teenagers that are being stalked by some creepy ghost girl. Standard
    stuff when it comes to the premise, but you can't seem to help yourself but be
    drawn in by the presentation. The atmosphere is so vivid. The sounds and voice
    feel like they are coming from inside of your house. In fact, the game is so immersive,
    the walls in your room literally started bleeding. How many games can say that?
  choiceText1: 1) Wait, what?
  choiceText2: 2) NO! No no no no. No. Now I have to clean my walls? At this hour?
    God. Fricken. Damnit!
  choiceText3: 3) Why don't the teenagers just stab the stalker and be done with it?
