  storyText: Agreed. The immersion is nice and all, but that's gonna be a bitch and
    a half to clean. Might as well start now before it gets any worse. You give up
    on gaming. You dash away from your comp, cursing every deity you can think of
    and start aggressively cleaning the  walls. You lose track of time, you only know
    that it feels like ages. Finally done, you go back to your computer, only to find
    that it switched to sleep mode and in front of your monitor lies a chopped-off
    pale female hand THAT BLEEDS ALL OVER YOUR STUFF AGAIN, OH MY GOD, WILL THE CLEANING
    NEVER END
  choiceText1: 1) For the love of frick. Why! I'm way too tired for this bullshit!
    Let's just clean this up and call it a day. I'm done with video games. Fricken
    hell. I do NOT have the energy to be a maid for the supernatural. (Objective complete-ish)
