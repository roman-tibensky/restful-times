  headerText: What IS in a name
  storyText: That's the one you picked up from that bizarre garage sale along with
    some of your new furniture. It doesn't have a box or anything, it's just a bland
    CD in a regular CD case that has the name of the game written on it with a sharpie.
    Your only assurance that this actually contains a game comes from the tall, skinny
    pale sales person with an unsettling smile. What could possibly go wrong?
  choiceText1: 1) Well, it says it's not a creepy pastry, so that's a start
