  storyText: 'The thrashing hand from the monitor was followed by, dark, greasy hair,
    hiding a pale visage. It''s at this point you come to the conclusion that whatever
    is trying to pass through your screen really, REALLY shouldn''t. Too bad you left
    your gun at the office. The only thing you got close to you is a trophy for best
    shot from back when you were a cop. Isn''t that ironic. '
