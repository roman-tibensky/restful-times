  storyText: "The thrashing hand from the monitor was followed by, dark, greasy hair,
    hiding a pale visage. It's at this point you come to the conclusion that whatever
    is trying to pass through your screen really, REALLY shouldn't. Too bad you left
    your gun at the office. The only thing you got close to you is a trophy for best
    shot from back when you were a cop. How ironic. \r\n\r\nThe repulsing head shook,
    as it gave out an amalgamation of raspy coughs, hisses and gasps for air. It slowly
    raised its head to look at you and BAM! You award her first place right between
    the eyes! How's it feel to be a winner, ya shriveled pasty monitor-abusing home
    invader! Apparently, that's all it takes too. The ghost goes cross-eyed and kinda
    just passes out and slumps over, then tips your monitor over with its weight.
    As the monitor hits the ground, the screen shatters and... cuts off the hanging
    body from whatever source it tried to crawl out of. You are left without a monitor,
    but hey, at least you have a ghost torso that bleeds all over your floor now instead.
    You take that as a win. Not because it is, one, but because games are put on hold
    indefinitely anyway. Plus the source of your entertainment for the foreseeable
    future will be cleaning this mess."
