  storyText: 'At your command, the teens pounced the ghost with zero hesitation. The
    ghost for some reason turned out to be surprisingly weak to conventional weapons.
    Didn''t even put up much of a fight either. While the teenagers relentlessly wailed
    on the ghost girl, all she did was toss them away a few times before being completely
    overwhelmed and then torn apart bit by bit. Literally. At first you didn''t quite
    understand what was happening, but the more you watched the scene the more gruesome
    the attacks became. This was by no means a fight for survival anymore. These pubescent
    monsters were cackling and making fun of their prey, while taking their sweet
    time savoring her pain. '
