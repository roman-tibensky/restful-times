  headerText: So real you can feel it
  storyText: You lean in closer to inspect the hand. As it thrashes around, you feel
    it brushing against your hair, then it suddenly stops and grabs at your face.
    Catching you completely off guard, the hand tucks at you with a vicious pull and
    slams you against the edge of your monitor. You scream more in confusion than
    pain, but your monitor is much less fortunate; it's screen fracturing into little
    pieces. The image is cut off completely. Aside from the arm. The arm stayed on
    this side, cleanly cut off from the rest of whatever was trying to get out. It
    now hangs from your face, bleeding everywhere. What a weird reward to get from
    a gaming session. And with the monitor busted this badly, it seems your game time
    came to a premature end.
