  storyText: "Innocently, you suggest a trade. Being stuck in a game, the fine ladies
    and gentlemen on the other side must be starving right about now. Would they not
    consider some food instead? Like perhaps... a pineapple pizza?\r\n\r\nYou are
    indeed both cunning and cruel, mentioning the dish that keeps on taking. Well,
    not the dish itself per se; more like the debates it spawned. Friendships shattered.
    Families ruined. Lives taken. All over the brutal discourse the combination of
    pineapple and ham ignites. And indeed, true to fashion, precisely half of the
    voices said yes and half of them no. Impressive in its own right, considering
    there was five of them. What followed was fairly standard. First confused looks
    were exchanged, then a few jokes at the expense of both the pro and anti camps
    were uttered, someone took those a bit too seriously, started an argument, the
    jokes got meaner, the arguments more aggressive, culminating in inevitable stabbings.
    You've seen this play out so, so many times, you've almost grown numb to it."
