  headerText: Painful irony
  storyText: The repulsing head shook, as it gave out an amalgamation of raspy coughs,
    hisses and gasps for air. It slowly raised its head to look at you and BAM! You
    award her first place right between the eyes! How's it feel to be a winner, ya
    shriveled pasty monitor-abusing home invader! Apparently, that's all it takes
    too. The ghost goes cross-eyed and kinda just passes out and slumps over, then
    tips your monitor over with its weight. As the monitor hits the ground, the screen
    shatters and... cuts off the hanging body from whatever source it tried to crawl
    out of. You are left without a monitor, but hey, at least you have a ghost torso
    that bleeds all over your floor now instead. You take that as a win. Not because
    it is one, but because games are put on hold indefinitely anyway. Plus the source
    of your entertainment for the foreseeable future will be cleaning this mess.
