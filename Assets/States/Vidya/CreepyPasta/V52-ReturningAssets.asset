  storyText: A hero and a gentleman, I see. Have it your way. The girl tries to put
    up a fight, but she's frail, tired and beat up; her pleas and cries hurt more
    than her fists. The sheer horror in her eyes, as you toss her back into the monitor
    will haunt your dreams almost as much as what the manic murder teen squad did
    to her, when she fell back into their world. The screams... the manic laughter.
    The grotesque display went on for so... SO long, yet you couldn't bring yourself
    to look away, making sure the darn things don't think about crossing over to get
    you as well. But no. Seems once they were done playing their autopsy games, the
    screen just went black and your computer along with your room turned back to normal.
    Except for the salt everywhere.
  choiceText1: 1) That... was a bit too immersive. I think I had enough video games
    for a while. (Objective complete!)

    definitely not haunted, because that would make you feel bad
