  storyText: "The girl hangs suspended from your arm, refusing to let go, hysterically
    yelling something incoherent. Below you, you see the group of teenagers coming
    closer to you, arguing about something you couldn't hear through all the screaming.
    Great, maybe they can help! You took care of them fairly well in-game, they should
    return the favor at least. And indeed, one of the teenagers lifted his knife and
    threw it at the ghost. Too bad the blade bore itself right between your eyes instead.
    Death was pretty quick\r\n"
