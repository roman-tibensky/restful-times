  storyText: As per usual none of the participants were left to tell the tale. Only
    a giant pile of blood, regret and unsatisfied hunger. Not even this hellish thing
    pretending to be a game could withstand the power of a conflict as old as time.
    The screen went black, the blood on the walls just up and disappeared. The only
    thing left to do, was to tend to the survivor. Apparently she lived like two towns
    over. Been missing for a week or so. You call her an ambulance and you two tried
    to agree on a cover up story. But the moment the medics arrived, they took one
    look at her and knew what was a up. Apparently, this is not even a unique occurrence.
    They even had special codes and procedures for people being abducted by ghosts!
    What the fuck! They swept your computer for more bizarre stuff, confiscated the
    game and took the girl as well, but treated her quite kindly, even made sure her
    family was informed. So that felt somewhat like a happy ending for the girl, if
    nothing else.
