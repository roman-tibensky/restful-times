  storyText: Well, you hesitated at first, but now you're determined to make up for
    it with at least some form of weapon. As the ghost girl clumsily made her way
    out of the monitor you leaped into the kitchen and took the biggest, most intimidating
    knife you could possibly find. Once you returned to your room, you find the girl
    laying sprawled on the floor, facing away from you, twitching lightly. Is... is
    that a ghost thing that only ghosts understand? I mean, it might be a bit creepy,
    but mostly because you have no idea what she's trying to accomplish there.
  choiceText1: 1) Lady, you are not allowed to sleep on my floor! Only I get to do
    that.
