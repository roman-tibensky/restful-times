  storyText: You take a few steps back. You watch as the hand reaches out and grabs
    at the edge of the table. It's followed by another, quickly grabbing firmly at
    the edge of the monitor. You swallow with anticipation. In the middle of the screen,
    a dark spot appeared. Slowly it turned into a clump of greasy unkempt black hair,
    that started sliding down your monitor and onto the table. As it pushed through,
    it revealed a head; the eyes covered by the black hairy mess. The moment the mouth
    made it out of the monitor, it gasped for air and started coughing, rasping in
    a sickly fashion. It almost looked like the thing was trying to articulate something.
    Whatever it tried to rasp at you, it looked painful. Almost as painful as the
    realization that you chose this night of all nights to leave your gun at the office.

  choiceText3: 3) Poop! Uhh... she's disoriented, grab a knife from the kitchen!
