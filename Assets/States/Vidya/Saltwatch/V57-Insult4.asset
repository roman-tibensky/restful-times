  storyText: Suddenly someone opens a door and floods the room with light, much to
    the protest of your battered brain. It takes a while for said brain to load the
    scenario you're in and the motion blur to be turned off, but once your view is
    properly rendered, you find the culprit behind the intense gamma increase.  It's
    Tony, your pizza guy. And that is a VERY bad thing. Better make sure you don't
    upset him further.
  choiceText1: 1) I thought I paid my pizza tab
  choiceText2: 2) Come on, I was winning
  choiceText3: 3) Hi... uhhh... how're the kids?
