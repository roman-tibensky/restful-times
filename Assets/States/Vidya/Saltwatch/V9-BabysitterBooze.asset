  storyText: Your head is throbbing still, you have a screaming gremlin breaking your
    stuff and bouncing on your couch and you're not allowed to dispose of it. You
    need some anesthetics before you even start dealing with this situation. Big glass
    of whisky it is. And when you return with a second shot to the living room, you
    see the couch trying to eat the mafia kid.
  choiceText1: 1) ... wait what?
  choiceText2: 2) ... ARE YOU KIDDING ME
  choiceText3: 3) Whatever, just pull the tyke out
