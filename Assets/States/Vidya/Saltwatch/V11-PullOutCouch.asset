  storyText: Quickly, you grab the kid and pull with all your strength. Just in time
    too. The terrified little bugger hangs off your arm. His pants are gone, but on
    the other hand, he's covered in a thick layer of drool, so you doubt he'll get
    cold. He's too traumatized to try anything and spends the evening shivering in
    the corner, leaving you to get some gaming done. When Tony's people come pick
    him up, they seem to be in a rush and don't even question the lack of pants. You
    decide not to ask any questions either
