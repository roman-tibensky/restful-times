  storyText: You heard me. While you were standing there with a dumbfounded stare,
    the couch ate the kid. When the mafia comes around, you try to sell off a puppet
    made out of a broom and potato sack as a decoy, but it doesn't scream every 2
    seconds, so it doesn't work. The kid is never found and they make sure you are
    never found again either
