  storyText: You decide to see what all the kids are raving about these days and give
    this Saltwatch thing a try. You log on and do a brief tutorial. The game seems
    fairly straightforward, really. You feel fairly confident in just jumping in and
    giving it a shot. You log into the multiplayer, find yourself a huge stack of
    salt and start staring at it. Hey, you're doing great!
