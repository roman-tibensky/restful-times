  storyText: Sadly, your thoughts were interrupted by the kid crying out from the
    kitchen, followed by muffled screams and sounds of struggle. Just great. You two
    are not alone in the mafia home. On the other hand, the little guy is now less
    loud. Small blessings?
  choiceText1: "1) Crap! The little one cannot be harmed! \r\nStorm into the kitchen!"
  choiceText2: 2) Crap! Hope they don't know I'm here! Hide and surprise them!
  choiceText3: 3) Crap! I'm unarmed! Look for a weapon!
