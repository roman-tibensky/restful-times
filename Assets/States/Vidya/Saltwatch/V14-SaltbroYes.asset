  storyText: 'Your offer of a mutual game was met with suspicion at first, then hesitant
    agreement, under the condition that you do everything the kid tells you to. Time
    passed and the two of you actually got some good progress in. When focusing on
    something, the little gremlin was actually quite calm, determined, and a surprisingly
    helpful teacher. The barrier between you two slowly gave way and you actually
    started to tolerate the boy. You two were actually making plans to do this again
    sometime, when a very concerned mafia member came and dragged him away without
    as much as looking you in the eye properly. Wonder what that was about. '
