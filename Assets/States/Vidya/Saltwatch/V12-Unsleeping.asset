  storyText: "Well... things happened. \r\nAnd, if nothing else, you like to think
    of yourself as a wiser man. Traumatized. But wiser. A man, who knows that while
    normal beings might be made of matter and energy, children are just 100% the latter.
    They consist of movement and sound. They cannot be contained, they cannot be silenced.
    You chase that ball of greased lightning all around your flat, but that just seems
    to encourage him more. It takes ages for him to even slow down. And you're just
    completely out of breath. Finally, the sweet release of your door bell ringing
    somehow makes a dent in the constant screeching of the child-siren. The mafia
    take the little abomination back with them. But you had your fill of adrenaline
    for the day. Video games are put on hold for the night."
