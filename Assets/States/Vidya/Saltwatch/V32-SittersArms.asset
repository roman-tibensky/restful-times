  storyText: It is true. You are in a mafia home. There's gotta be some weapon lying
    around. It is also a home you are unfortunately thoroughly unfamiliar with. You
    make a lot of noise unsuccessfully looking for a gun. The trespassers then find
    you gnawing in frustration at a locked gun case. They then promptly show you how
    to use a weapon properly.
