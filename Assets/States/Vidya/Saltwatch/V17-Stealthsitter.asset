  storyText: You don't know who would attack the mafia munchkin nor how many there
    are. You feel it would be best to get a drop on at least one of them. Just outside
    of the kitchen, you jump into a closet and wait for them to pass by. Seems like
    there's two thugs. Both armed. One sweeping the path ahead, one holding the kid
    at gun point.
  choiceText1: 1) Get the scout.
  choiceText2: 2) Get the one with the hostage
  choiceText3: 3) Not your problem. Get out of there when they pass
