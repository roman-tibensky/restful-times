  storyText: You wait for them both to pass, then with a well aimed blow knock out
    the thug holding the kid, taking his gun and before he even fell to the ground,
    you opened fire on the second thug. With a heavy sigh, you tell the kid to call
    his dad. He immediately obeyed, seeing as you just killed two people in cold blood.
    Tony was furious beyond measure, but thankfully this time his scorn was not aimed
    at you. It still took some time for them to get there. In the meantime, the kid,
    trying to win the favor of his savior, offered you his gaming library. Your evening
    was enriched by a bunch of lent titles, plus free pizza for a year for your services
    to the family.
  choiceText1: 1) Wait... no gamer fuel to go with it? Last time I'm saving kids from
    a kidnapping. (Objective complete!)
