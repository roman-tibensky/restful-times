  storyText: Let's face it. You suck. And everyone else is probably cheating anyway.
    But hey, if you can't beat them, join them! You browse the net, to look for something
    suitable to your needs. Et voila! The best bots the net can offer! You load everything
    up, start the game and watch your CPU fire up with excitement! Quite literally.
    Your computer is now on fire. It's not stopping. What have you done. Whether this
    was a problem with your bot implementation or just outdated hardware, we can safely
    surmise you are done with PC games for the evening.
  choiceText1: 1) Damnit! Just play a stupid mobile gacha game for a bit and call
    it a day. (Objective complete-ish)
