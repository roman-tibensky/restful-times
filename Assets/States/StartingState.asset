  storyText: You're finally home. Finally, finally home. The day sucked harder than
    a jet engine. You're tired, you're hungry, your brain feels broken beyond repair

    you finish up this disaster of a day?
  choiceText1: 1) I should grab a bite to eat first
  choiceText2: 2) Sleep! Just pass out! Let the day end!
  choiceText3: 3) My brain's too busy. I need to calm down with some games
